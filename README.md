### Version 0.9_1
- removed option to install speedtest-cli, only supporting ookla speedtest
- updated to support OPNsense 22.7 (FreeBSD 13)

### Version 0.7_1
- removed automatic invocation of install_speedtest.sh from GUI
- removed the bug on widget control
- fixed the display of stats when there are zero records in the csv

### Version 0.7
- no dependency at install time; plugin detects if speedtest is missing and allows installation
- complete rewrite of Python wrapper (opn_speedtest.py) that now accepts tons or parameters:
-> no paramter == default speedtest test
-> numeric parameter == server id for specific speedtest test
-> t or list == list of the nearest 10 speedtest servers
-> l or log == show the most recent 50 results from CSV file
-> s or stat == display statistics of all tests in CSV file
- added the install_speedtest.sh with three paramters:
->  bin == install Oookla binary
->  cli == install Python speedtest-cli
->  delete == uninstall it all

### Version 0.6

### Version 0.4

- moved the speedtest menu entry into the Reporting menu structure

### Version 0.3
- added log output at the bottom - with the export and delete actions
- cron job accepts the speedtest serverid as an argument to lock down the target for cron jobs

### Version 0.2

- added the api call to execute the statistical test: `/api/speedtest/service/run`
- added the api call to get json with statistics: `/api/speedtest/service/stat`
- added the output to .csv file - all tests for statistics are inserted into `/usr/local/opnsense/scripts/OPNsense/speedtest/speedtest.csv`
